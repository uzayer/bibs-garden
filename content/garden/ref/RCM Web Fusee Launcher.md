## Extra Info

---

- Continue at your own risk!
- This does NOT work on Windows due to a limitation in the Chrome implementation of WebUSB (and probably other reasons!) On Windows, you can use [TegraRcmSmash](https://switchtools.sshnuke.net/)
- This does NOT currently work on any browser except for Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Samsung Internet and QQ Browser. This is because they don't implement WebUSB. For up to date information, visit [caniuse.com/webusb](https://caniuse.com/webusb).
- On Linux, you might get an access denied error! If you do, you can try creating a file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-switch.rules`
	With the following contents:
	`SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0955", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"`
- This has been tested and appears to work on Linux, macOS, Android (unrooted) and Chromebooks.
